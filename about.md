I'm a PHP Web Developer from Sheffield, UK currently working as a Developer at [Hotsnapper](http://hotsnapper.com).

I love to write code and learn new things so check out my [GitHub](http://github.com/mikebarlow) for any cool things I may have created. I'm also trying to get better at writing hence the posts on this site! Hopefully they may be of use to some people.
