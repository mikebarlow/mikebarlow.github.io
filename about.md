I'm a PHP Web Developer from Sheffield, UK. Currently working at [Aiir](http://aiir.com) and also the co-founder of [WHSuite](http://whsuite.com) - an online hosting / domain billing solution, currently in Beta / Release Candidate stage.

I have a great desire to learn more and push myself to do better with the code I wrote, hence this new personal site. With a full time job and trying to release WHSuite, free time for learning more and improving my own skills and knowledge has taken a back seat. Hopefully this personal site will give me a push to learn more and write about what I've learnt
