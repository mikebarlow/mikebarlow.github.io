So this is my first post back on my personal site. Using this site as a testing playground and also a writing platform to try and learn more and increase my skills.

Hoping that by making an effort to improve the site and also blog about what I'm doing it will help with my understanding of a lot of what I'm doing and learning.

The first few posts in the near future will most likely be on server management and things I've started to learn while taking my first steps into server management for this site.
